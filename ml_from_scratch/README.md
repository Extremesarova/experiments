##Maching Learning Algorithms From Scratch
The sole purpose of this small sub-repository is to understand the concepts of machine learning algorithms - how they work under their hood. </br>
The code was not designed to be used by someone else (poorly documented, has no unit tests) - it is just a draft, investigational-purposed code. </br>
Writing it help me grasp the idea behind the base algorithms. </br>
Based on this knowledge I'm mastering concepts behind the more advanced architectures, like gradient boostings, neural networks and so on.
